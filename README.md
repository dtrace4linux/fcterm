<h1 align="center">FCterm - color terminal emulator</h1>

## About

FCTerm is a terminal emulator. First written many years ago - circa 1990,
since X11/XTerm had no support for color at that time. It allowed the CRiSP
Editor (http://www.crispeditor.co.uk) to be bootstrapped into full
GUI land, back when the choices for building GUI's were in their very
earliest stages of creeping out of their childhood years.

FCTerm has always been fast - occasionally surveying the competitors,
but also, merging in the key desirable features. FCTerm supports

- freetype fonts
- color
- multiple tabs
- auto-restart
- restore of screen content and working directory
- resizable / relayout of screens
- grouping
- infinite scrollback
- searching
- multi window mode
- asciicast session recording
- theme support

The original code was built for the X11/Athena widgets, which have
long since been deprecated; a version was built for Motif, but, that too
has been deprecated. So, it runs with its own toolkit, which is
crude (ie the right-menu popup menu).

Use "fcterm -help" and "fcterm help" to see the interactive commands.
